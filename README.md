Description: A Hoi4 mod that is a prequel to The New Order: Last Days of Europe. This mod focuses on the rise of Nazi Germany and its allies from 1933 to the 1960s, from the Reich's revival and subsequent victory in the Second World war to internal politics.

To ensure a seamless transition from the mod to TNO, the former will have as little difference with the latter, with regards to interface, writing style and complex narratives.
