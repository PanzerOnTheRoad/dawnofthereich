 ARG_adolfo_hlr_desc:0 "Adolfo HLR is the illustrious leader of the... let's see, oh yes, the Argentinian Front for National Restoration! A proud and completely Argentinian organization. Born in Brau... I mean, Braagauville, a small village in the far reaches of... um, Patagonia! His accent, which some mistakenly think sounds German, is just a rare Patagonian dialect, obviously.\n\n\To protect his numerous friends and family (he definitely has a lot of those), he uses the name Adolfo HLR, standing for His Loyal Resurgence. Any resemblance to a certain infamous Führer is purely a wild coincidence. Adolfo will swear up and down that he and Adolf Hitler are two different people and that there are plenty of photos of them together, which are unfortunately always misplaced.\n\n\Adolfo HLR’s plans upon securing victory include creating strategic partnerships with a certain prominent European power. When asked about the specifics of these plans, Adolfo HLR becomes evasive, offering assurances with a strangely intense stare that everything is meticulously planned and completely legitimate."
