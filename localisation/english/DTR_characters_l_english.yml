 adolf_hitler_desc:0 "Adolf Hitler, in 1936, stands at the zenith of his power as Führer and Reichskanzler of the Greater German Reich. The undisputed leader of a resurgent Germany, he has captivated the nation with his fiery oratory and iron-willed determination. The architect of the Third Reich's ambitious revitalization, Hitler has shattered the constraints of the Versailles Treaty and reignited national pride. Under his watchful eye, the Swastika has become a symbol of renewed strength and unity, flying high over a nation reborn.\n\n\In the aftermath of the Great War, Germany was left crippled by the punitive measures of the Versailles Treaty, its economy shattered and its people humiliated. The Great Depression only exacerbated these struggles, plunging the nation into deeper despair and economic turmoil. It was in this crucible of suffering that Hitler's vision took root, offering a promise of redemption and resurgence that resonated deeply with the disillusioned masses.\n\n\In the six years since he assumed control, Hitler's combination of relentless propaganda and brutal enforcement has silenced dissent and rallied the populace behind his vision of a grand and dominant Germany. The Wehrmacht grows stronger with each passing day, and the seeds of a new, fearsome military machine are being sown. His grand designs for the future are epitomized by the plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, a testament to his ambition and the future he envisions.\n\n\Despite his humble beginnings as the son of an Austrian customs official, Hitler's rise to power has been nothing short of meteoric. His failed attempt in the Beer Hall Putsch only solidified his resolve, transforming him into a political force of unparalleled magnitude. Now, in 1936, Hitler's voice still commands the fervent devotion of the masses, his presence a blend of magnetic charisma and chilling authority.\n\n\As Europe watches with a mix of awe and apprehension, the fearsome leader plots the next steps in his grand design. The world holds its breath, knowing that under Hitler's guidance, the course of history is being irrevocably altered, and the future of Europe hangs precariously in the balance."

 ##Argentinian descs##
 ARG_adolfo_hlr_desc:0 "Adolfo HLR is the illustrious leader of the... let's see, oh yes, the Argentinian Front for National Restoration! A proud and completely Argentinian organization. Born in Brau... I mean, Braagauville, a small village in the far reaches of... um, Patagonia! His accent, which some mistakenly think sounds German, is just a rare Patagonian dialect, obviously.\n\n\To protect his numerous friends and family (he definitely has a lot of those), he uses the name Adolfo HLR, standing for His Loyal Resurgence. Any resemblance to a certain infamous Führer is purely a wild coincidence. Adolfo will swear up and down that he and Adolf Hitler are two different people and that there are plenty of photos of them together, which are unfortunately always misplaced.\n\n\Adolfo HLR’s plans upon securing victory include creating strategic partnerships with a certain prominent European power. When asked about the specifics of these plans, Adolfo HLR becomes evasive, offering assurances with a strangely intense stare that everything is meticulously planned and completely legitimate."
