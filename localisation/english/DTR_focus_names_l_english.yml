### GERMAN Focus names ###

 GER_a_new_spark_of_resolve:0 "A New Spark of Resolve"
 GER_a_new_spark_of_resolve_desc:0 "When the dust of the Great War subsided, Germany found itself shackled by the exploitative clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, ridden with the vengeful desires of the triumphant west. Our once formidable nation was forced to grapple with crippling reparations, severe territorial losses, and a humiliated military stripped of its might."
GER_occupy_the_rhine:0 "Occupy the Rhine!"
 GER_occupy_the_rhine_desc:0 "Ever since 1919, the Treaty of Versailles has been a burden heavy upon the Fatherland, a symbol of humiliation and shame. But no more! With the renewed resolve under the leadership of our beloved Fuhrer, we cast off the shackles of oppression and stand defiant once more as an independent, and perhaps even greater, Germany.\n\nOur first bold step towards this goal is the reclamation of the Rhineland, a region that has long been under the influence of western powers. Tolerated too long by the error-laden, decadent Weimar Republic, this abomination of Versailles must be confronted by force. The world may doubt our strength, especially after the dishonorable loss in the Weltkrieg, but every soldier, every worker, and every citizen, stands united in our resolve to restore Germany's rightful place among the great nations of the world."
